## Project Summary

This project investigates patterns in immigration inadmissibility decisions in Canada Using structured datasets from **Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC)** and unstructured [**federal court decision texts**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/refugee-law-lab/canadian-legal-data), we aim to uncover insights into legal trends, systemic disparities, and judicial decision-making.

The project leverages exploratory data analysis, statistical inference and natural language processing. The final product will be a **public-facing interactive dashboard** built using **Python and Dash**, designed to make these datasets interpretable for legal professionals, policymakers, and the public.
