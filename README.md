# Welcome!

ðŸŒŸ We're so glad you're here! Thank you for visiting the our project repository.

ðŸŒŸ This README is a friendly guide to everything about the project. Whether you're here to explore what our dashboard offers, learn about our mission, or find ways to contribute, you've come to the right place! ðŸ¥³

# Project Summary

This project investigates patterns in immigration inadmissibility decisions in Canada Using structured datasets from **Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC)** and unstructured [**federal court decision texts**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/refugee-law-lab/canadian-legal-data), we aim to uncover insights into legal trends, systemic disparities, and judicial decision-making.

The project leverages exploratory data analysis, statistical inference and natural language processing. The final product will be a **public-facing interactive dashboard** built using **Python and Streamlit**, designed to make these datasets interpretable for legal professionals, policymakers, and the public.

## Running the Dashboard Locally

This repository contains several Streamlit pages located in `dashboard/pages/`. You have two main ways to explore them:

#### Option 1: Full Dashboard (All in One)

Launch a complete dashboard with 3 curated Data Stories + 2 interactive explorers from the **project root directory** using the following command in the terminal where the conda enivornment is active.

``` bash
# full dashboard (3 stories + 2 explorers)
streamlit run dashboard/pages/index.py
```
You can find our dashboard deployed [here](https://public-transparency-for-immigration-law-in-canada.streamlit.app/)

#### Option 2: Run Individual Modules

If you want to launch just one page, you can run any of the following scripts from the **project root directory**.

| Script                      | What it shows                                                         | Command                                   |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------|

| `africa_vs_non_africa.py`   | Litigation Outcomes story by continent-level (Africa vs. Non-Africa)  | `streamlit run dashboard/pages/africa_vs_non_africa.py`   |
| `litigation_dashboard.py`   | Litigation Outcomes story by country-level                            | `streamlit run ldashboard/pages/itigation_dashboard.py`   |
