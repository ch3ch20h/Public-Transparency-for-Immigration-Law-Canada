# Welcome!

ðŸŒŸ We're so glad you're here! Thank you for visiting the Public-Transparency-for-Immigration-Law-Canada project repository.

ðŸŒŸ This README is a friendly guide to everything about the project. Whether you're here to explore what our dashboard offers, learn about our mission, or find ways to contribute, you've come to the right place! ðŸ¥³

# Project Summary

This project investigates patterns in immigration inadmissibility decisions in Canada Using structured datasets from **Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC)** and unstructured [**federal court decision texts**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/refugee-law-lab/canadian-legal-data), we aim to uncover insights into legal trends, systemic disparities, and judicial decision-making.

The project leverages exploratory data analysis, statistical inference and natural language processing. The final product will be a **public-facing interactive dashboard** built using **Python and Dash**, designed to make these datasets interpretable for legal professionals, policymakers, and the public.
