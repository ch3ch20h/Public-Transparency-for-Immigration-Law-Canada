    "# Reproducibility Issues When Using Large Language Models (LLMs)\n",
    "The use of large language models, such as LLaMA 3, introduces several challenges for reproducibility in computational workflows, especially within legal reserach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stochastic Nature of LLMs\n",
    "- LLMs generate outputs based on probabilistic sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unless temperature and random seeds are controlled precisely (and even then, not always guaranteed), the same input prompt may yield different outputs on different runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This undermines deterministic reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Model Version Variability\n",
    "- LLMs like LLaMA 3 can be updated over time (e.g., new training data, fine-tuning changes).\n",
    "\n",
    "- A prompt run today may return a different result in future versions, making long-term reproducibility difficult without strict version pinning.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Hardware and Deployment Differences\n",
    "- Running the same model on different systems (e.g., GPU-enabled vs CPU-only, local vs cloud-based) can affect latency, performance, and in some cases, output formatting or completeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Prompt Sensitivity\n",
    "- Minor changes in wording, spacing, or line breaks in a prompt can lead to substantially different model outputs.\n",
