## IRCC A34(1)Refusals dataset

For the IRCC A34(1) Refusals dataset (2019–2024), we observed the following issues:

1.  **Missing Data in A34(1):** The number of refusals for both permainent and temporary residents under A34(1)are empty (see Figure 1). It's unclear whether this reflects an actual absence of refusals or missing entries. Due to the extremely low counts of refusal we are not able to statistically test the biases and perform any causal inference.

2.  **Lack of Decision Authority Context:** The dataset does not specify whether the refusals were issued by a visa officer, the Immigration Appeal Division, or the Federal Court. The absence of a decision_authority field prevents us from understanding the institutional source of the refusal. Moreover, it is unclear whether these records reflect final decisions or if some may have been overturned on appeal. No accompanying metadata or data dictionary is provided to clarify these definitions.

3.  **Inconsistent Country Labels:** The country naming conventions are inconsistent. For example, both “Congo” and “Democratic Republic of the Congo” appear, which could lead to double-counting or misclassification.

## IRCC Litigation Applications dataset

For IRCC Litigation Applications from 2018 to 2023, we observed the following issues:

1.  **Undefined Outcome Terminology：** Leave decision terms shown in Figure 2, such as “Dismissed at Leave,” “Withdrawn at Leave,” “Allowed,” and “Allowed – Consent,” are not formally defined in the dataset. For example, we don’t know whether “Allowed – Consent” means the Minister consented to the application or if it is simply a sub-category of “Allowed.” Without clear definitions, meaningful comparisons across outcome categories are not possible.

2.  **Unclear Refugee Case Coverage：** We cannot confirm whether all refugee cases are captured under RAD/RPD decisions or whether they may appear in Mandamus, Removal Orders, or other categories.

3.  **Incomplete Timeline Information：** Only decision dates are recorded, while filing dates and original application dates are missing, so we cannot assess processing times.

4.  **Unspecified Decision Offices：**
    As shown in Figure 3, a significant proportion of litigation cases,around 16k cases, are attributed to “Unspecified” primary decision offices, which prevents meaningful insight into office-level counts.
IRCC should include these office details.
